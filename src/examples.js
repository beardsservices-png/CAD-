      "A complete real job: existing rock wall and house, four 4×4 posts, a doubled 2×6 beam " +

      "Build steps — press ‹ › at the bottom right to assemble it one stage at a time",
      "Existing (reference only) — the house and rock wall are ghosted and never counted",
      "Materials — the button up top itemises everything, with hardware suggestions",
      "Layers — turn Ceiling, Roofing or Trim off to see what's underneath",
      "Labels — every piece is named, which is what makes the takeoff readable",
